## Motivation and Story
My client gave me direction by giving me a mock of what the Overview should look like. From there we went in depth of the nitty gritty details of what should occur in certain situations. From there we had a document full of requests and I went to work on creating the end product. Through timeblocking using trello with my team and organizing my own schedule around the deliverables I was able to create a overview section that surpassed client expectations.
